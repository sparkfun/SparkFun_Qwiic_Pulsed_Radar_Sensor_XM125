!!! note
    The SparkFun Pulsed Coherent Radar Sensor - Acconeer XM125 uses the CH340 USB-to-serial converter as opposed to the CP210x that is linked in Acconeer's tutorials. You may need to install drivers for the USB-to-serial converter. Check out our section on "[How to Install CH340 Drivers](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ch340-drivers)" for help with the installation.

!!! note
    The Acconeer Exploration Tool may run slower than expected when using the SparkFun Pulsed Coherent Radar Sensor - Acconeer XM125 with the software.
