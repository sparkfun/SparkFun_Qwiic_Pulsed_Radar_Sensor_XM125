Now that you've successfully got your SparkFun Qwiic Pulsed Coherent Radar Sensor - XM125 up and running, it's time to incorporate it into your own project! With the SparkFun Qwiic Pulsed Coherent Radar Sensor, a world of new project possibilities opens up. Imagine creating presence detection systems for smart homes and security applications, parking space occupancy detection, gesture recognition interfaces for unique user control, level measurement (for example, in tanks or waste containers), through-wall imaging systems for search and rescue, or even advanced robotics with object avoidance and navigation.
